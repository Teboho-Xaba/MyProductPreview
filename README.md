# MyProductPreview

This is my version of Frontend Mentor's Product Preview Component Card

# HTML:

The HTML is quite basic, it's only a container with two divs - one containing the image of the product and the second one containing the information of the product such as its category, name, description, current and previous price, and the "Add to cart button".

# CSS:

Set the container's display to grid, which is an easier way to make columns, the use grid-template-columns and set it to two 1frs to make two columns.
